    The past week has been a rollercoaster for the cryptocurrency market, with significant volatility across major and minor cryptocurrencies.

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):  </strong>
    <p> 
        Bitcoin continued its upward trajectory this week, closing at $104,499, marking a 3.51% gain over the past seven days. The flagship cryptocurrency exhibited notable volatility, with prices ranging from a weekly low of $100,210 to a high of $108,154, demonstrating the market's continued dynamic nature.
    </p>
    <img src="btc_price.png" alt="BTC price">
    <p> 
        The week's price action has formed a consolidation pattern above the crucial $100,000 mark, with decreasing volatility as the week progressed. This consolidation, coupled with the positive weekly return, suggests a potentially constructive setup for the coming week, though traders should remain vigilant of broader market conditions and potential catalysts.
    </p>
    <p> 
        While the market shows signs of strength with its ability to hold above key support levels, the proximity to resistance near $106,000 warrants attention. Traders should watch for a potential breakout above this level or a retest of support, with volume patterns likely to provide important confirmatory signals.
    </p>

        
    </li>
        
        

     
      
      
      
      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH): </strong>
      <p> 
        Ethereum displayed positive momentum this week, closing at $3,299, registering a 2.95% gain over the seven-day period. The second-largest cryptocurrency moved largely in tandem with Bitcoin, though with slightly lower returns compared to BTC's 3.51% weekly gain.
      </p>
      
     
      
       <img src="eth_price.png" alt="ETH price">
       
       <p> 
       The week's trading pattern reveals a constructive market structure, with prices maintaining stability above the $3,200 psychological level. The decreasing volatility within the established range suggests a potential energy build-up, which could lead to a directional move once resolved. The high correlation with Bitcoin indicates that broader market sentiment remains a crucial factor for ETH's price action.

    <strong>Focus On Volatility</strong>
    
    <p>
    The past week has shown interesting developments in the volatility landscape of the two leading cryptocurrencies, with notable divergence in their risk patterns.

    <p>

    <ul>
   
      <li>
        <strong> Bitcoin:</strong> Bitcoin's volatility profile shows a moderate upward trend over the past week,
         with the current realized volatility sitting slightly below the weekly average of 57.15%. 
         The relatively tight volatility range suggests stable market conditions, though the upward trend in volatility indicates growing market uncertainty.
         
         
      </li>
      <li><strong>Ethereum  </strong>
      Ethereum has experienced a significant decline in realized volatility, currently sitting at its weekly low.
      This substantial decrease in volatility (-24.66 percentage points) suggests a market that's becoming more orderly,
       with reduced price swings compared to the beginning of the week.

      </li>

    </p>
    

    <p>
    <strong>Key Insight</strong>

    <ul>
   
      <li>
        <strong> Volatility Divergence::</strong> While Bitcoin's volatility has shown a slight increase, Ethereum's has significantly 
        decreased, leading to an unusual situation where ETH's realized volatility is actually lower than BTC's. This is relatively rare historically.

         
      </li>
      <li><strong>Risk Regime: </strong>: Both assets are currently operating in a moderate volatility environment, 
      with readings well below their respective 95th percentiles (BTC: 60.47%, ETH: 78.93%).
      

      </li>
      <li><strong>Market Stability: </strong>The contrasting volatility trends between BTC and ETH suggest a potential
       decoupling in their risk characteristics, which could offer diversification benefits for portfolio management.

   <strong>Risk Outlook</strong>
   <ul>
   The divergent volatility patterns between BTC and ETH suggest we might be entering a period of independent price action. Bitcoin's gradually increasing volatility warrants attention, while Ethereum's declining volatility might present opportunities for volatility trading strategies.
   
   </ul>

      <h3 style='text-align: center'>Alternative cryptos</h3>
      
      The cryptocurrency market displayed divergent performance patterns over the past week, with significant disparity between major and mid-cap assets.
       The most dramatic movement came from SUI, recording a 9.22% decline to $3.93, accompanied by substantial volatility as evidenced
       by its 34.84% trading range. This weakness in SUI was echoed across several mid-cap assets, with Stellar (-6.15%) and HBAR (-5.01%) also experiencing notable downward pressure.
       <br><br>
In contrast, TRON emerged as the week's standout performer, advancing 3.61% to $0.25 in relatively orderly trading. Chainlink also demonstrated strength
 with a 1.28% gain, while Solana maintained its recent stability with a modest 0.56% increase to $236.67.
  The resilience of these larger-cap assets suggests a potential flight to quality within the crypto ecosystem.
  <br><br>
The major Layer-1 platforms showed remarkable stability, with BNB nearly flat at $679.13 and Avalanche's modest 2.22% decline to $34.11 occurring
 in controlled trading conditions. This stability in foundational blockchain platforms contrasts sharply with the volatility seen in smaller-cap assets, 
 potentially indicating a maturing market structure for established protocols.
 <br><br>
Stablecoin performance remained exemplary, with both USDT and USDC maintaining tight pegs to the dollar. USDC in particular displayed exceptional
 stability with a mere 0.05% trading range, providing reliable liquidity for market participants. The liquid staking derivatives market continued to closely
  track Ethereum's performance, with both stETH and wstETH showing highly correlated price action.
  <br><br>
The week's trading patterns suggest an increasingly sophisticated market where volatility and risk are more concentrated in speculative,
 mid-cap assets while major cryptocurrencies maintain more structured trading ranges. This bifurcation could present both opportunities 
 and challenges for market participants as the ecosystem continues to evolve.

        <p>
        The cryptocurrency market shows an overall positive volatility skew, with market-wide upside volatility
         averaging 48.81% compared to downside volatility of 39.39%. This asymmetry suggests a constructive
         market environment where positive price movements dominate negative ones.
        </p>
          
        <p>
        Solana leads in asymmetric opportunities, with upside volatility of 86.39% against downside volatility of 39.04%, resulting in the highest upside/downside ratio of 2.21. Stellar and XRP follow this pattern, with Stellar showing the market's highest absolute upside volatility at 129.20%. These assets appear positioned for substantial positive price movements while showing relatively contained downside risk.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        In contrast, several cryptocurrencies display defensive characteristics. Toncoin exhibits the most defensive profile with an upside/downside ratio of 0.48, indicating more frequent and larger negative price movements. USDC maintains minimal volatility in both directions (0.34% upside, 0.47% downside), while Avalanche shows a moderately defensive stance with higher downside volatility (56.62%) than upside (45.55%).
        </p>
        <p>
        This diversity in volatility profiles reflects a maturing market where different assets serve distinct investment purposes, from aggressive growth opportunities to defensive positions. The clear segmentation enables investors to construct portfolios aligned with their risk preferences, challenging the notion that cryptocurrencies are uniformly high-risk assets.

        <li>
        Current realized volatilities show a wide gap between BTC (44.21%) and ETH (62.63%), 
        reflecting ETH's traditionally higher activity. However, our 30-day forecast indicates a significant convergence,
        with BTC expected to rise to 59% while ETH moves to 69%.
        </li>
        <li> 
        The notable projected increase in Bitcoin's volatility
         (+33% from current levels) versus Ethereum's more modest rise 
         suggests evolving market dynamics. This convergence often precedes periods
         of increased market activity and stronger correlation between the two assets.
        </li>
        <li>
        Traders should prepare for potentially choppier markets ahead, particularly 
        in Bitcoin where the expected volatility increase is more pronounced.

        <h2 style='text-align: center'>Token Spotlight: Risk OFF</h2>
        <section class="token-info">
        When the market turns turbulent, <strong>Risk OFF</strong> acts as your safety net. 
        This week, it showcased its prowess by minimizing losses in an otherwise volatile market environment.
   
   
    <p>
       <strong> Key benefits </strong>
       <ul>
           <li>Better Sleep at Night: When you hold crypto directly, there's no protection against price crashes.
            With Risk OFF, you know that even in a market crash, your losses are limited.
           </li>
           <li>More Predictable Investment Experience:
               Direct crypto investing can feel like a rollercoaster. Risk OFF smooths out this experience by:
               
               <br>- Limiting your downside (you know the maximum you could lose)
               <br>- Still letting you profit from price increases up to a certain level
               <br>- Providing a clear risk-return profile that's easier to fit into an overall investment strategy
           </li>
           <li>Stay in the Market: Unlike stop-loss strategies where you have to exit your position (and might miss the recovery), 
           Risk OFF keeps you in the market. This means you can participate in the recovery if prices bounce back after a dip.
           </li>
    </p>

    </section>


  
    <p>With ETH volatility expected to remain elevated ober the next 30 days, consider allocating 10-20% of your portfolio to <strong>Risk OFF</strong>. This will help protect against potential downside while allowing you to stay exposed to ETH’s upside potential.</p>

        <p>Volatility in crypto isn't just about numbers; it's about opportunity and risk. Here's a quick primer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Realized Volatility:</strong> The actual price variability of an asset over a specific time period, typically expressed as an annualized percentage. For instance, Bitcoin's 60% realized volatility means it typically fluctuates within a 60% range over a year.</li>
            <li><strong>Implied Volatility:</strong> The market's forecast of likely future price movements, derived from options prices. Higher implied volatility suggests traders expect larger price swings ahead.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> The asymmetry in returns distribution. Positive skewness indicates more frequent small losses but occasional large gains, while negative skewness suggests the opposite pattern.</li>
